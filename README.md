# Getting Started

Installation

    Ensure you have Python 3 and pip (the package manager) installed on your system. You can find download instructions at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Dependencies

    Install the required Python package bcrypt using pip:
    
    pip install bcrypt


Use code with caution.
Run the Application

    Download or clone the repository.
    
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
    
    Run the main script using python main.py (or python3 main.py if necessary).

Usage

The application will guide you through registration or login. Once logged in, you can add, view, and (in future versions) update or delete your workout records.
To-Do

    - Develop a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive experience.
    
    - Explore options for hosting the database online for remote access and collaboration (consider security implications).
    
    - Create a single executable file (.exe) for easy distribution once the GUI is implemented.
